# PCB Design Details – Week 01
**Project:** AC–DC Linear Power Supply Board

---

## 1. Output Specification
* **Output voltage:** 12V DC
* **Maximum load current:** 1A
* **Input:** 230VAC, 50Hz

## 2. Transformer Selection
**Secondary voltage:** 12VAC RMS  
**Peak secondary voltage:**

$$V_{peak} = V_{rms} \times 1.414$$
$$V_{peak} = 12 \times 1.414 = 16.97\text{V or } 17\text{V}$$

This defines the maximum rectified voltage before diode drops.

**Transformer rating selected:**
* 12VAC / $\ge 20\text{VA}$
* **Power Requirement:** $P_{out} = 12\text{V} \times 1\text{A} = 12\text{W}$
* **Margin:** 20VA provides adequate headroom for losses and heating.

## 3. Bridge Rectifier Selection
Two diodes conduct per half-cycle ($V_{drop} = 0.7\text{V} \times 2 = 1.4\text{V}$).

**Peak DC after rectification:**
$$V_{DC\_peak} = 17\text{V} - 1.4\text{V} = 15.6\text{V}$$



### PIV Requirement
For a bridge rectifier, $PIV = V_{peak} = 17\text{V}$. 
* **Selection:** Rectifier rated $\ge 100\text{V}$ (safety margin).
* **Current:** Rated $\ge 2\text{A}$ to tolerate repetitive charging pulses.

## 4. Bulk Capacitor Sizing
* **Capacitance:** $10,000\mu\text{F}$
* **Ripple frequency:** 100Hz (full-wave)

**Ripple estimation:**
$$V_{ripple} = \frac{I}{f \times C} = \frac{1}{100 \times 0.01} = 1\text{V}$$

**Minimum input to regulator ($V_{min}$):**
$$15.6\text{V} - 1\text{V} = 14.6\text{V}$$

## 5. Regulator Headroom (7812)
* **Dropout voltage:** 2V
* **Minimum required input:** $12\text{V} + 2\text{V} = 14\text{V}$

**Status:** $14.6\text{V} > 14\text{V}$ (Pass ✅)

## 6. Power Dissipation & Thermal
* **Average $V_{in}$:** $\approx 15\text{V}$
$$P_{diss} = (V_{in} - V_{out}) \times I = (15 - 12) \times 1 = 3\text{W}$$

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A **heatsink is mandatory**. Thermal considerations are included in the PCB layout by providing copper areas around the regulator tab and allowing for airflow clearance.

## 7. Bleeder Resistor ($10\text{k}\Omega$)
**Purpose:**
* Discharge bulk capacitor after power-off.
* Provide minimum load stability.

**Current:** $I = 12 / 10000 = 1.2\text{mA}$  
**Power:** $P = 12^2 / 10000 = 0.014\text{W}$  
*0.25W resistor used for reliability margin.*

## 8. LED Indicator Resistor ($2.2\text{k}\Omega$)
Assuming LED forward voltage = 2V:
$$I_{LED} = \frac{12 - 2}{2200} = 4.5\text{mA}$$
Safe operating region for a standard indicator LED.

## 9. Surge Current Consideration
At power-up, the capacitor is initially uncharged; charging current is limited mainly by transformer impedance.

**Observed in simulation:**
* Narrow, high-amplitude current pulses.
* Peak current significantly above steady-state load.

**Protection measures:** Input fuse and series NTC thermistor.

## 10. Decoupling and Stability
Regulator stability ensured using:
* $0.33\mu\text{F}$ at input (close to regulator).
* $0.1\mu\text{F}$ at output.
* $10\mu\text{F}$ electrolytic for additional smoothing.

Components placed physically close to regulator pins to **minimise** loop inductance.

## Key Design Conclusions
* **$10,000\mu\text{F}$** ensures $\approx 1\text{V}$ ripple at 1A load.
* Minimum valley voltage remains above regulator dropout threshold.
* Regulator dissipates $\approx 3\text{W}$ under full load; thermal management required.
* Bridge rectifier must tolerate high peak charging current, not just average current.

This PCB was designed after validating ripple behaviour, conduction angle, and surge current in **LTspice** to ensure hardware reliability prior to fabrication.
