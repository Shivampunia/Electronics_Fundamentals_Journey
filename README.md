# Electronics_Fundamentals_Journey

Structured development of analog electronics through theory, simulation, and hardware implementation.

This repository documents weekly progression through disciplined study and practical execution. Each module includes:

- Theory scope
- Design calculations
- LTspice validation
- PCB implementation
- Design decisions and limitations
The goal of this phase is to build strong analogue and circuit-level fundamentals before advancing to higher-level embedded and system integration work.

Phase 1 Focus:

- Diodes and rectification
- Signal shaping circuits
- Linear regulation
- BJT characteristics
- Biasing methods
- Amplifier design
- Foundational PCB layout practices
- This phase emphasises analytical reasoning, simulation verification, and practical hardware realisation.

Highlighted Builds:

- Week 01 – AC–DC Linear Power Supply Board
- Week 03 – BJT CE Amplifier PCB (in progress)

Weekly Structure:

Each week follows a consistent workflow:

- Concept study
- Analytical modelling
- LTspice validation
- PCB realisation
- Design review and improvement
